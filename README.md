# Fraud-Detection-System-Python-Machine-Learning

In this project, I show you how to build a powerful fraud detection system using machine learning in Python. 
Step by step, I walk through the entire process that helped me achieve 94% accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions.

Here’s what you’ll learn along the way:

How to preprocess and clean data for machine learning

How to apply feature engineering to improve model performance

How to choose and train the right machine learning models with Scikit-learn

How to evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics

I’ve used some of the most popular Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to make the workflow clear and practical.

By the end of this project, you’ll understand how to build, optimize, and evaluate a fraud detection model on your own. 
Whether you’re just starting out or already experienced in data science, this project will give you real-world insights into applying machine learning to financial fraud detection.
